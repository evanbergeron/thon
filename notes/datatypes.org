SML 90 got local datatype declarations a bit wrong -
let datatype t = C in C end
was legal, but is not in SML 97.

SML 97 disallows C to escape the scope. This is similar to the
type-checking for existential packages - that plus the generativity of
`use` (`use` declares a type var) may be why we want to elaborate to
existential packges.
